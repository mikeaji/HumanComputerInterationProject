        <a name="Koromah"><h3>So what is Virtual Reality?</h3></a>
        <p> Virtual Reality is a way of detecting a persons presence in a game via bio-sensing, these sensors can be attached to a data glove
        ,glasses or even suits in order to record movements made by that person; also being in sync with the gameplay so the movements made by the person
        wearing the equipment triggers a range of responses made by the AI. So essentially YOU become a vital part of the game thus, makes it
        an immersive experience for example you could think you were in space yet when taking off the Virtual Reality glasses; still be in the same location
        you are still in physically - MIND BLOWING </p>

        <h3>Music in the gaming industry</h3>
        <p> Music is the confluence and a powerful tool that is used in games as it controls emotions and can establish the tone of the story being told within that game
        this allows the gamer to really be apart of that game internally so the best user experience possible!</p>
